# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables = containers for storing data values
	* Strings = used for storing & manipulating text. Stores a series of characters like "John Doe". A string can be any kind of text inside quotes & you can use single or double quotes - the quotes can't match the quotes surrounding the string.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) = a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
	* `if` statements = used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Use the if statement to specify a block of code to be executed if a condition is true.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) = represents one of two values: true or false. It can only take the values of true or false. You can use the Boolean function to find out if an expression (or variable) is true.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
